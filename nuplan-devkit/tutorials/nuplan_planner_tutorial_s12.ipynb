    "Welcome to the nuplan planning tutorial. One of the core interactions with nuplan will be to build and train your own planners and run them through nuplan's simulation pipeline for evaluation. While we discuss how to train your machine learned planners in other tutorials, in this tutorial we will show you the basic elements you will need for constructing a planner that plugs into the nuplan interface. We will also show you the basics of running the planner in simulation and visualizing the behavior and metrics for evaluation."

    "The planner is the main component responsible for determining the ego vehicle's behavior. At it's core, a planner will consume state information in the form of observations regarding its own pose, poses of other agents, and various static and dynamic map information, along with a goal, and produce a trajectory dictating the future path that the ego vehicle will attempt to follow according to a given control strategy.\n",

    "\n",
    "**name**: The name of the planner. This one's easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "**observation_type**: This dictates what type of observations the planner will consume to inform it's decision making. Options here include *Sensors* (raw sensor information such as images or pointclouds) and *DetectionsTracks* (outputs of an earlier perception system designed to consume sensor information and produce meaningful detections).\n",
    "\n",
    "**compute_trajectory**: This is the core behavior of the planner, and the part you will most likely spend the most time on. This method will consume a history buffer containing discretized past ego trajectory information as well as observations of the type declared in *observation_type* up until the current time step. Correctly accounting for historical as well as current information will allow the planner to produce more stable and strategic behaviors and avoid overcorrecting in the presence of noisy observations. The *compute_trajectory* method will be responsible for producing the trajectory dictating the path the ego vehicle will attempt to follow in the future. The trajectory represents the series of ego states (identifying pose along with dynamic information such as velocities and accelerations) the vehicle will try to attain along a specified time horizon, most easily represented as a list of states along with a method to interpolate between them.\n",
